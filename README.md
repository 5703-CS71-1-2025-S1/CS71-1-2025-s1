# Welcome 
This project is a capstone for COMP5703 at the University of Sydney.   Our goal is to explore how Large Language Models (LLMs), like GPT, can assist in the adaptive hyperparameter optimization of machine learning models by guiding heuristic algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) .

We aim to reduce manual tuning effort, improve optimization efficiency, and build a closed-loop system.
