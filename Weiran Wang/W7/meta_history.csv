1,0.6,2.0,1.5,0.6925094594204273,Inertia weight is set at lower value (0.6) for the particle to lend less weight to its past velocity and hence allows exploration of new regions (as opposed to exploiting discovered optima). Cognitive and social coefficients are set relatively high to prioritize learning from its own and neighbors' best known positions. Cognitive coefficient (2.0) is set higher than social (1.5) to better navigate the landscape due to higher diversity among particles.
2,0.6,2.0,1.5,0.6889275472352084,"We are in the early stages of the Swarm Optimization process and the particle AUC results span a wide range (0.6498 to 0.6889). Therefore, we select a moderate value for the inertia weight to balance exploration (global search) and exploitation (local search). A higher cognitive coefficient encourages particles to follow their own best known positions, aiding fine-tuning. A moderate social coefficient value, slightly less than the cognitive coefficient, is set to allow particles to learn from the global best known position, aiding variety and exploration, but with a slight bias towards exploitation."
3,0.6,2.0,1.5,0.6571455450978128,"The optimal solutions are clustered closely but not converging so we can slightly reduce the inertia weight to encourage exploration. The cognitive coefficient remains moderately high to preserve individual particle's memory. The social coefficient is raised further to encourage collaboration among particles in their search for the optimum, as labor division seems effective."
4,0.6,2.0,1.5,0.6739341698610692,"The particle swarm is not converging quickly, as indicated by the variance in AUC among the top particles. Therefore, let's decrease the inertia weight to enhance exploration over exploitation. Also, increasing cognitive coefficient may improve individual learning, while raising social coefficient could boost global influence, potentially leading to higher performance."
5,0.6,2.0,1.5,0.6861738552760254,Inertia weight is reduced slightly to encourage exploration as current parameters aren't yielding especially high AUC scores. Cognitive coefficient is increased to more strongly consider particle's own best known positions. Social coefficient is kept moderate to still maintain a balance with the swarm's best known position.
6,0.6,2.0,1.5,0.6725734162433825,"The AUC score improvements suggest a good balance between exploitation and exploration. Lowering inertia weight encourages further exploration for global optimum and less reliance on previous velocities. A higher cognitive coefficient guides particles towards personal best, and a modest social coefficient suggests the swarm's best so far has been useful but not overwhelmingly better than individual particles' performances."
7,0.6,2.0,1.5,0.6241056154090555,"The inertia weight is reduced to 0.6 to increase the emphasis on exploration over exploitation, as the AUC scores seem to be plateauing, indicating the necessity to find new promising areas in the hyperparameter space. The cognitive coefficient is increased to 2.2 to encourage individual particles to explore areas of the search space in the vicinity of their personal best solutions. The social coefficient is kept at 1.5 to maintain a balance of swarm's overall best solution."
8,0.6,2.0,1.5,0.6274383848220143,"Given the best particles derived from the PSO search space have closely related MLP hyperparameters and the AUC scores are not dramatically different, increasing the cognitive_coeff to boost individual particle memory could help fine-tune the parameters. A moderate inertia_weight can be maintained to balance exploration and exploitation, and slightly lower social_coeff to reduce overall swarm intelligence intensity, considering our top particles are already quite similar."
9,0.6,2.0,1.5,0.6205194944522613,"The AUC score decreases with increasing learning rate, indicating that the particles might be overshooting the optimal solution. Lowering the inertia weight can help confine the search and prevent overshooting. Given the general downward trend, raising the cognitive coefficient could help particles learn from their own experiences. A moderate social coefficient is recommended to balance between individual learning and swarm learning."
10,0.6,2.0,1.5,0.5905133463447644,"The performance varied across iterations for the similar parameters. Hence, we need a balance between exploration (global best) and exploitation (personal best). Thus, I've decreased the inertia weight to limit each particle's tendency to keep moving in its current direction. However, to further encourage convergence to the optimal model parameters, I increased the cognitive coefficient to give more weight to the personal best of each particle. Finally, since the top performing hyperparameters show quite similar results, it seems that social interaction is less key here, so the social coefficient is lowered."
