Based on the historical training logs, we can observe some consistency in the hyperparameter values that yield high AUC scores. Let's analyze each hyperparameter:

1. **Hidden (number of neurons):**
   - The values range from approximately 78 to 86.
   - To reduce fluctuation and narrow the search, we can set a range slightly tighter around these values.

2. **Learning Rate (lr):**
   - The values range from approximately 0.0057 to 0.0068.
   - A tighter range can be set around these values to maintain consistency.

3. **Dropout:**
   - The values range from approximately 0.29 to 0.39.
   - We can narrow this range to focus on the middle values that appear more frequently.

==== Round 6 GPT Response ====
To optimize the hyperparameters for the MLPClassifier and reduce fluctuation across rounds, we should focus on narrowing the search ranges based on the top historical configurations. Here's the analysis:

1. **Hidden Neurons**: The values are consistently around 113 to 119. We can narrow this range slightly to focus on the most promising area.
2. **Learning Rate (lr)**: The values range from 0.0013 to 0.0083. The top configurations are closer to the lower end, so we can narrow this range.
3. **Dropout Rate**: The values range from 0.177 to 0.370. The top configurations are spread across this range, so a moderate narrowing is appropriate.
4. **L2 Regularization**: The values range from 0.0034 to 0.0098. The top configurations are spread across this range, so a moderate narrowing is appropriate.

==== Round 7 GPT Response ====
To optimize the hyperparameters for the MLPClassifier and reduce fluctuation across rounds, we need to analyze the historical training logs and identify consistent patterns in the top configurations. Based on the provided logs, we can observe the following:

1. **Hidden Neurons**: The values are consistently around 92 to 113. This suggests a narrower range around these values.
2. **Learning Rate (lr)**: The values range from approximately 0.0055 to 0.0098. We can narrow this range slightly to focus on the more successful configurations.
3. **Dropout Rate**: The values range from approximately 0.11 to 0.20. We can narrow this range to focus on the more successful configurations.
4. **L2 Regularization**: The values range from approximately 0.0035 to 0.0046. We can narrow this range slightly to focus on the more successful configurations.

Based on these observations, the final answer for the hyperparameter search ranges is:

Final Answer: {
  "hidden": {"min": 90, "max": 115},
  "lr": {"min": 0.0055, "max": 0.0098},
  "dropout": {"min": 0.11, "max": 0.20},
  "l2": {"min": 0.0035, "max": 0.0046}
}

==== Round 8 GPT Response ====
Based on the historical training logs, we can observe that the top configurations are quite consistent, especially in terms of the number of neurons and learning rate. The dropout rates and L2 regularization values also show some consistency, but with slightly more variation. To reduce fluctuation across rounds and narrow the search ranges, we can focus on the following:

1. **Hidden Neurons**: The values are consistently around 112, with a slight variation. We can narrow the range to focus around this value.
2. **Learning Rate (lr)**: The values are consistently around 0.0078, with slight variations. We can narrow the range to focus around this value.
3. **Dropout Rate**: The values vary a bit more, but generally stay between 0.11 and 0.18. We can narrow the range slightly.
4. **L2 Regularization**: The values are consistently around 0.004, with slight variations. We can narrow the range to focus around this value.

Final Answer:
```json
{
  "hidden": {"min": 110, "max": 115},
  "lr": {"min": 0.007, "max": 0.009},
  "dropout": {"min": 0.12, "max": 0.18},
  "l2": {"min": 0.0039, "max": 0.0043}

==== Round 9 GPT Response ====
To optimize the hyperparameters for the MLPClassifier and reduce fluctuation across rounds, we need to analyze the historical training logs and identify consistent patterns in the top configurations. Based on the provided logs, we can observe the following:

1. **Hidden Neurons**: The values range from approximately 78 to 117. The top two configurations have hidden neurons around 78 and 81, suggesting a potential sweet spot in the lower end of this range. However, configurations with higher values (around 112 to 117) also perform well, indicating a broader range might be beneficial.

2. **Learning Rate (lr)**: The learning rate values are generally low, ranging from 0.0006 to 0.0084. The top two configurations have learning rates around 0.0063 and 0.0073, suggesting a narrower range around these values might be optimal.

3. **Dropout Rate**: The dropout rates vary significantly, from 0.07 to 0.445. The top configuration has a dropout rate of 0.304, and the second has 0.445, indicating a preference for higher dropout rates. However, the third configuration has a much lower dropout rate of 0.07, suggesting some variability is acceptable.

4. **L2 Regularization**: The L2 values range from 0.0025 to 0.0084. The top two configurations have L2 values around 0.0074 and 0.0080, suggesting a preference for higher L2 values within this range.

Based on these observations, we can propose the following narrowed search ranges:

Final Answer: {
  "hidden": {"min": 75, "max": 120},
  "lr": {"min": 0.006, "max": 0.008},
  "dropout": {"min": 0.25, "max": 0.45},
  "l2": {"min": 0.007, "max": 0.0085}
}

==== Round 10 GPT Response ====
Based on the historical training logs, we can observe some patterns in the hyperparameter values that have led to higher AUC scores. Let's analyze each hyperparameter:

1. **Hidden**: The number of neurons seems to be around 81 to 112. The top configurations are consistent in this range, so we can narrow it down slightly.
2. **Learning Rate (lr)**: The learning rate values are consistently around 0.0065 to 0.0078. We can narrow this range further.
3. **Dropout**: The dropout rates vary but are generally between 0.27 and 0.44. We can narrow this range slightly.
4. **L2 Regularization (l2)**: The L2 values are consistently around 0.007 to 0.0084. We can narrow this range slightly.

Given these observations, here is the refined search range for each hyperparameter:

Final Answer: {
  "hidden": {"min": 80, "max": 115},
  "lr": {"min": 0.0065, "max": 0.0078},
  "dropout": {"min": 0.27, "max": 0.44},
  "l2": {"min": 0.007, "max": 0.0085}
}
